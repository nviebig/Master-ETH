# Master-ETH
Projects i did in my Master at ETH Zurich

These Projects include:

**Semester Project Gratting Nuller**: In this project, I’m designing and testing a grating nuller, an optical instrument used to suppress starlight and enhance high-contrast imaging capabilities for studying faint objects near bright sources, like exoplanets. The experimental setup involves building the nuller using a visible 633 nm laser light and analyzing its throughput performance with respect to theoretical predictions. By comparing experimental results with theoretical models, I aim to understand and optimize the grating nuller’s efficiency and alignment, contributing valuable insights to high-contrast imaging techniques in astrophysics.
