## Projects Completed During My Master's at ETH Zurich

This repository showcases various projects I undertook during my master's program at ETH Zurich. 

### Semester Project: Grating Nuller
In this project, I am designing and testing a **grating nuller**, an optical instrument used to suppress starlight and enhance high-contrast imaging capabilities for studying faint objects near bright sources, such as exoplanets. 

The experimental setup involves:
- **Building the nuller** using visible **633 nm laser light**.
- **Analyzing its throughput performance** in relation to theoretical predictions.

By comparing experimental results with theoretical models, I aim to:
- Understand and optimize the grating nullerâ€™s efficiency and alignment.
- Contribute valuable insights to high-contrast imaging techniques in astrophysics.
